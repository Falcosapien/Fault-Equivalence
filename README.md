# Fault-Equivalence
In this project, I applied fault equivalence methods for testing and verification to generate a gate-level circuit from a given ISCAS netlist. The ISCAS benchmark circuits are commonly used for testing and evaluating various fault diagnosis techniques. Fault equivalence aims to reduce the complexity of testing by identifying and grouping faults that produce identical effects on the circuit's output, allowing for more efficient testing. The project also involved analyzing the controllability and observability of the circuit, which are critical parameters in designing testable circuits. Controllability refers to the ease with which a particular logic value can be set at a specific point in the circuit, while observability refers to the ease with which the effects of a specific point can be observed at the circuit's outputs. My role in this project was to design the logic that could generate a gate-level circuit from a reduced ISCAS netlist. This involved parsing the netlist to extract the necessary information and then constructing the corresponding gate-level representation. 

Additionally, I developed algorithms to perform fault equivalence analysis, which involved identifying and grouping faults with identical behavior. I also worked on methods to analyze the controllability and observability of the generated circuits, ensuring that our designs were easily testable and faults were detectable. My contributions were crucial in creating a streamlined process for transforming ISCAS netlists into optimized, testable gate-level circuits. The outcomes of this project were significant in demonstrating the effectiveness of fault equivalence methods and the developed logic. The logic for generating gate-level circuits from ISCAS netlists proved to be efficient and reliable. The fault equivalence analysis and controllability/observability methods provided valuable insights into the fault behavior and testability of the circuits. 

Furthermore, our research paper based on this project was selected for presentation at the National Conference of The Institution of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers (IETE) in the 55th Mid-Term Symposium on "SEMICON @ 2030: TRENDS AND TECHNOLOGIES FOR VIKSIT BHARAT". This recognition underscored the impact and relevance of our work. This project enhanced our understanding of fault diagnosis techniques and highlighted the importance of controllability and observability in designing testable circuits. It also showcased my ability to develop complex logic and analysis methods using Python, contributing to the successful completion of the project.
